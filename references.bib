A data partitioning method by sampling is proposed. The complexity and the performance of the sorting and partitioning algorithm are analyzed. Storage bounds and the choice of parameters which determine the sampling size are also discussed. The analysis is developed for parallel sorting in a local network environment, with distributed data sets in secondary storage devices. 9 references.},
